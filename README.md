👾E̲x̲t̲r̲a̲:
    kekeke...The Computer Tech has come a VERY-LONG way,
from simple calcs to devices that solved the 
number-crunching problem of riduculous population
growth in US...

To finaly having overpowered computing abilities on
top of our palms able to launch multiple early 
space-rockets to space simultaneously!

It going to have a exciting future.

⚡️D̲i̲d̲ ̲y̲o̲u̲ ̲k̲n̲o̲w̲?

Computers are capable of cracking passwords,but they take time.
Its not the strength but the length that matters more.

it may take a normal pc upto a year to crack a password.
but! it will take 31.5 seconds 
to crack ur password with botnet brute force attack
of a million computers!
